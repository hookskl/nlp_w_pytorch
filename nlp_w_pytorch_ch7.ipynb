The RNN has no control of what values are retained versus which ones are discarded. A more desirable behaviour would be to let the RNN decide when to update and by how much or what parts to update.\r\n",

        "Second, for really long sequences, Vanilla RNNs tend to suffer from numerical stable gradients. In these cases, the gradients can shrink towards `0` (*vanishing gradients*) or grow to infinity (*exploding gradients*). Either case has severe consequences on the model's ability to train. Techiniques exist for dealing with these gradient issues (ReLU, gradient clipping, etc.) but fail to improve the model better than using *gating*."

        "\r\n",
        "Here $\\lambda$ acts as a \"switch\" or \"gate\", controlling how much $b$ contributes to the total sum. This is the basic idea behind gating in RNNs. To see how this is incorporated, recall how the Elman RNN updates the hidden state vector: $$h_t=h_{t-1}+F(h_{t-1}, x_t) \\text{, where}$$ $$h_t \\text{ is the hidden state vector at some time step }t,$$ $$x_t \\text{is the input at some time step }t, \\text{ and}$$ $$F \\text{ is the recurrent computation of the RNN}$$\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "but now instead of being a constant, $\\lambda$ is function of the previous hidden state vector and current data input and still maps values to $[0,1]$. The function $\\lambda$ controls how much of the current input gets to update the hidden state $h_{t-1}$, as well as being context dependent. This is the basic idea behind all gated RNNs. \r\n",

        "The primary difference in this sequence classification task is how the state vectors computed by the RNN are handled. Previously, a single vector per batch index was retrieved and predictions were performed using those single vectors. However, now the 3D tensors are reshaped into 2D tensors (a matrix) such that the row dimension represents every sample (batch and sequence index). The matrix is fed into the `Linear` layer and a prediction vector is computed for every sample. The output matrix is then reshaped back into a 3D tensor. The reshaping is done purely to accomodate the linear layer requiring a matrix as input."
